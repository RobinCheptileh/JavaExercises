#JAVA EXERCISES

This is a set of five simple Java exercises. The project is organized in such a manner that it has a main file (Main.java) where it lists all questions and allows you to choose which you'd like to view the solution.
The questions are as follows:
1. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n
2. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives him the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,â€¦,n.
3. Write a function that returns the largest element in an array
4. Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in an array
5. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints it's factorial using recursion

Feel free to change to change the code to your liking and happy coding! :bowtie:
